## SYSC4810 Assignment 3

This is an example implementation of a password checking system, written for assignment 3 of SYSC4810. The code can be
run using the included docker file, go modules, or run.sh. In the future the strength submodule will be extracted into
its own repo. Additionally, there is some concurrency work that is not strictly necessary, but was done for learning
purposes.

The entry point is main in main.go
